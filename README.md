Key ingredient - From a high-level view, these are the three basic components that make up

main.py - This involves recording the userâ€™s voice, capturing the
words from the recording (cancelling any noise and fixing distortion in the process), and
then using natural language processing (NLP) to convert the recording to a text string

brain.py - component that receives the text string from the STT
engine and handles the input by processing it and passing the output to the TTS enginebrain; 
it handles user queries via a series of if - then - else clauses in the Python programming language. 
It decides what the output should be in response to specific inputs.

tts.py - This component receives the output from Mlogic engine and converts the string to
speech to complete the interaction with the user

conversation.py - This involves building additional third-party modules to be implemented in logic engine
(ex- time module,weather module,news module,wikipedia module.etc )
