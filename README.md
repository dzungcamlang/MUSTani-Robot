# Humaniod_SpeechFramework build in python

# Abstract:

MUSTani detects words/patterns based on learned results <br />
MUSTani must be trained to get results <br />
MUSTani works offline <br />
MUSTani recognizes words/patterns in real time and requires a multi core processor architecture <br />
MUSTani is highly configurable for quick and dirty results as well as for more precise recognition <br />
MUSTani was tested and developed with Python 2.7 on a Raspberry Pi 2 <br />
MUSTani comes with a very simple plugin interface for further processing <br />

# Key ingredient - From a high-level view

main.py - This involves recording the userâ€™s voice, capturing the
words from the recording (cancelling any noise and fixing distortion in the process), and
then using natural language processing (NLP) to convert the recording to a text string

brain.py - component that receives the text string from the STT
engine and handles the input by processing it and passing the output to the TTS enginebrain; 
it handles user queries via a series of if - then - else clauses in the Python programming language. 
It decides what the output should be in response to specific inputs.

mustani.py - Motion Control based on trained aatribute

tts.py - This component receives the output from Mlogic engine and converts the string to
speech to complete the interaction with the user

conversation.py - This involves building additional third-party modules to be implemented in logic engine
(ex- time module,weather module,news module,wikipedia module.etc )
